These PaMs have been reported by European countries under the European Union (EU) Monitoring Mechanism Regulation (MMR) in 2020 (Cyprus, Germany, Greece, Latvia and Slovenia), 2019 (Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom) and in 2017 (Austria and Romania). The search engine gives access to detailed information for each of the PaMs (or groups of PaMs). Countries report main characteristics of the PaMs, such as their description, objective, type, status, sectors affected, related Union Policy, entities responsible for their implementation, implementation period, etc. Where available, quantitative information on the GHG emissions savings achieved by PaMs (or groups of PaMs), both ex post (retrospectively) and ex ante (anticipated savings), as well as the projected and realised costs and benefits of the reported PaMs are reported.</span><br/><span>Clicking on the ‘Name of policy or measure’ opens the PaM national report.
