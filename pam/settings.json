These PaMs have been reported by Member States under the European Union (EU) Monitoring Mechanism Regulation (MMR) in 2017 and 2018. The search engine gives access to detailed information for each of the PaMs (or groups of PaMs). Member States report main characteristics of the PaMs, such as their description, objective, type, status, sectors affected, related Union Policy, entities responsible for their implementation, implementation period, etc. Where available, Member States also reported quantitative information on the GHG emissions savings achieved by PaMs (or groups of PaMs), both ex post (retrospectively) and ex ante (anticipated savings), as well as the projected and realised costs and benefits of the reported PaMs. Clicking on the ‘Name of policy or measure’ opens the PaM national report.</span><br/><br/><span>To facilitate reporting by Member States, the EEA has developed an online reporting questionnaire available via <a href='http://webforms.eionet.europa.eu/'>ReportNet</a> and ‘Guidelines for reporting on policies and measures by Member States under Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 (EU Monitoring Mechanism Regulation)’, available at:  <a href='http://cdr.eionet.europa.eu/help/mmr'>http://cdr.eionet.europa.eu/help/mmr</a></span><br/><span>The latest reported information (2017) is analysed in the report, <a href='https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/national-policies-and-measures-on/'>National policies and measures on climate change mitigation in Europe in 2017</a>, and the related briefing, <a href='https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/climate/national-policies-and-measures/tracking-climate-policies-in-european'>Tracking climate policies in European Union countries</a>.For more information, check also the <a href='https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/climate/national-policies-and-measures'>Policies and measures dedicated subpage</a>.</span>",
